## Data Encryption  

These workshops demonstrates server side encryption, client side encryption and certfificate management concepts within AWS. For example :

* How do I put an object on S3 with server side encryption ?
* How do I use aws encryption sdk to encrypt data in my application before sending the data to an AWS service ?
* What is Data Key Caching ?
* How I generate X.509 certificates with AWS Certificate Manager to enable TLS on my AWS infrastructure ?
* How do I use AWS Certificate Manager to generate a private certificate authority ?
* How do I generate a certificate for my webserver or device from an AWS Certificate Manager private certificate authority(PCA) ?
